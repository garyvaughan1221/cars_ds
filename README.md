# Exploring the Cars Dataset using Streamlit for Python

Just a coding example of how streamlit can be used with data to make data visualizations.  During this quick project, I noticed that Americans are/were the gas guzzlers on this planet.  lol.


## To Run
After installing all the dependencies open a terminal window.
Type 'streamlit run cars_ds.py'
